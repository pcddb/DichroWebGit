DichroWebGit

DichroWebGit is a user-friendly, free-to-download-and-use software program that enables the analyses of circular dichroism (CD) and synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) spectroscopic data. It has been created to replace the DichroWeb secondary stucture analysis web server when and if the server is no longer available.

Instructions

    Download the DichroWebGit repository and save the files onto your hard drive.
    Open the DichroWebGit folder, which contains three folders: datasets, doc and DichroIDP. Do not remove any of these folders. 
    Keep the whole package as it is.
    Open the DichroWebGit folder and click on the .exe file (also make a shortcut to this file and put it on your desktop).
    There is a full set of instructions in DA_help.http accessed via the help menu. 
    If help does not open directly from the help menu, the file can be found in the doc folder.
    If you wish to create your own dataset open a dataset files which contain four text files: lbl1.txt, lbl2.txt, A.txt and F.txt. 
    copy the files to another folder named after your new dataset, then replace the data in them with your own data.
        A.txt contains CD data in columns from a high wavelength of 240nm
        F.txt contains secondary structure data for each protein in a.txt in the same order using structural assignments found in lbl1.txt
        lbl.2txt contains 1 row of protein labels in the same order.
        Now load the dataset into the application as described in the help file.
